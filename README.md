# ðŸ§  Omarchy Dev
A calm and practical development space for Omarchy Linux â€” focused on building small, neuro-friendly tools, stacks, and themes that make computing feel lighter and more focused.

## âœ¨ Purpose
Omarchy Linux is already a clean, minimal, and opinionated Arch-based desktop for developers.  
This project continues that philosophy: instead of adding *more*, we refine *what matters*.  
Every stack, theme, and script here is designed for people who value clarity over clutter.

## ðŸ§© Whatâ€™s inside
- **stacks/** â€“ modular focus helpers (scripts for quiet mode, idea logging, etc.)
- **themes/** â€“ visual calmness: colors, contrast, typography
- **hypr/** â€“ Hyprland configs and keybindings
- **docs/** â€“ design philosophy, changelog, roadmap

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bjornshomelab/omarchy-dev.git
cd omarchy-dev/stacks/focus-mode
bash focus-mode.sh
